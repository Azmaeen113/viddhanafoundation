Implement a complete multi-language system for this multi-page website with 7 languages: Chinese (Simplified), Hindi, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean.

Requirements:

1. LANGUAGE SWITCHING MECHANISM:
   - Add a language selector dropdown/button in the navigation bar
   - Store the selected language in localStorage to persist across page navigation
   - Default language should be English
   - When language changes, dynamically update all text content on the current page without page reload

2. TRANSLATION STRUCTURE:
   - Create a centralized translations.js file with a nested object structure
   - Format: translations[languageCode][pageId][elementKey] = "translated text"
   - Language codes: 'en' (English), 'zh' (Chinese), 'hi' (Hindi), 'es' (Spanish), 'fr' (French), 'vi' (Vietnamese), 'ja' (Japanese), 'ko' (Korean)
   - Include translations for: navigation menu items, page headings, body text, button labels, form labels, placeholders, error messages, footer text

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
   - Add data-translate="key-name" attributes to all HTML elements that need translation (except terms that should remain in English)
   - Create a main language.js file that handles language detection, switching, and DOM updates
   - On page load, detect saved language from localStorage and apply translations immediately
   - Create a function that loops through all elements with data-translate attribute and updates their textContent or innerHTML
   - Handle special cases like input placeholders, button values, and alt text for images

4. NAVIGATION BAR COMPONENT:
   - Add a language selector with flags or language names
   - Make it accessible on all pages
   - Show current selected language with visual indicator
   - Dropdown or modal design that lists all 7 languages

5. TRANSLATION QUALITY:
   - Use natural, contextually appropriate translations for each language
   - Maintain tone consistency across all languages
   - Keep common English terms (like brand names, technical terms, or internationally recognized words) in English if appropriate
   - Ensure proper character encoding (UTF-8) for all special characters

6. PERFORMANCE:
   - Lazy load translations if the file becomes large
   - Minimize layout shift when switching languages
   - Ensure fast language switching (under 100ms)

7. TECHNICAL DETAILS:
   - Use vanilla JavaScript or adapt to existing framework (React/Vue/etc)
   - Ensure RTL language considerations are handled if needed in the future
   - Make the system scalable for adding more languages later
   - Add comments in code for easy maintenance

Please generate:
- Complete translations.js file with sample translations for all pages
- language.js file with all switching logic
- Updated HTML structure with data-translate attributes
- CSS for the language selector component
- Instructions for adding new translations

Start with the core language switching functionality and translation structure.

## Follow-up Prompts for Specific Components

### For Navigation Bar:
```
Create a language selector component for the navigation bar that:
- Displays current language with a flag icon or language code
- Opens a dropdown/modal showing all 7 languages (Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean)
- Has smooth animations and is mobile-responsive
- Calls the language switching function when a language is selected
- Updates the displayed language immediately after selection
- Includes hover and active states for better UX
```

### For Translation File Structure:
```
Generate a comprehensive translations.js file with this structure:
- Organize by language code at the top level
- Within each language, organize by page identifiers (home, about, contact, etc.)
- Within each page, use descriptive keys for each text element
- Include translations for: nav menu, hero section, feature descriptions, call-to-action buttons, form fields, footer links
- Ensure all special characters are properly escaped
- Add helpful comments explaining the structure
```

### For Applying Translations:
```
Create a robust language.js file that:
- Detects saved language preference from localStorage on page load
- Provides a setLanguage(languageCode) function
- Updates all elements with data-translate attributes
- Handles special cases: input placeholders (placeholder attribute), images (alt attribute), meta tags (if needed)
- Saves language preference to localStorage
- Dispatches a custom event when language changes for other scripts to listen to
- Includes error handling for missing translations
- Falls back to English if translation key is not found
```

### For HTML Updates:
```
Update all HTML pages to support multi-language:
- Add data-translate="uniqueKey" to every text element that needs translation
- Use semantic naming for keys (e.g., "nav.home", "hero.title", "contact.form.email")
- Keep brand names, product codes, and specific English terms without data-translate attribute
- Ensure all form inputs have data-translate on their placeholder attribute if needed
- Add language selector component to the navigation bar
- Include the translations.js and language.js scripts before closing body tag
```

---

## Prompt for Testing & Edge Cases:
```
Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases:
- Handle missing translation keys gracefully (fallback to English)
- Prevent layout breaking when text length varies significantly between languages
- Add loading state during language switch if translations are fetched async
- Test with long German-like compound words and short languages
- Ensure proper character encoding across all pages
- Add console warnings in development mode for missing translations
- Create a validation script to check if all translation keys exist across all languages
```

## Tips for Using These Prompts:

1. **Start with the main prompt** - paste it into Copilot and let it generate the core structure
2. **Use follow-up prompts** one at a time to refine specific components
3. **Review generated code** and ask Copilot to fix any issues: "Fix the language switching to work with the existing navigation structure"
4. **Request explanations**: "Explain how the translation lookup works" or "Add comments to this function"
5. **Iterate gradually**: "Now add French translations for the homepage" then "Add Spanish translations"

These prompts are structured to help Copilot understand the full context while breaking down the implementation into manageable pieces.
